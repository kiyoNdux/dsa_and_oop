# **Accessing an Element in an Array**

1. **Know the Data Structure**

   * We have a fixed-size collection of elements (an array) where each element can be directly accessed using its position (index).
   * The index starts from `0` for the first element and increases by 1 for each subsequent element.

2. **Identify the Target Index**

   * Decide which position in the array we want to retrieve data from.
   * Store that index in a variable or use it directly.

3. **Use Direct Indexing**

   * Arrays allow *constant-time* (O(1)) access.
   * Acrecess the desired element by placing the index in squa brackets: `array[index]`.

4. **Output or Process the Element**

   * Once accessed, the value can be used for display, computation, or any other operation.
   * In this case, the element is printed to the screen.
